# Spring Boot Movie Recommendation System 

## Introduction

Our Movie Recommendation System allows users to be recommended movies based on their preferences and what movies they interact with. 
It will incorporate a user service that has the user's profiles, a movie service that handles all the movie data, and a recommendation 
service that uses the user's preferences and selections of movies to be suggested movies.
